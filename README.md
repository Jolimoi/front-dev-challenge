# Front-End Developer Interview Challenge

At Jolimoi we believe design is a collaborative process between designer and developer.
This goal of this task is to assess your technical skills as a developer, but also your ability to give and accept feedback, and work in a team. Accordingly, you will have access to the designer during the task.

Communicate your thought process while developing and don't be afraid to ask questions. Work with the designer to make the best possible solution to achieve the goal of the application.

Use any online resources you see fit.

## Evluation
